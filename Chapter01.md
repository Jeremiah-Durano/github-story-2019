# Chapter 01

Spring is a beautiful season. It is like a bridge, in charge of linking two seasons together. 
The coldness and harshness of winter to the scorching heat and the elegant sunshine that summer brings. 

Spring's moderate temperature's, make it a season of rebirth.  Where there's more daylight,the  day's are longer 
and the night's shorter. Given the fact that Spring gives us more daylight hours, research has shown 
that it is a good mood-booster. The better our mood, the happier and more productive we are. And the more sun light we get 
the more fun we have with our peers.
Not only does the days get longer 
but the temperature somewhat becomes warmer. 

Fun fact the first day of Spring is called "The Vernal Equinox". 
'Vernal' being the Latin word for Spring.
'Equinox' being the Latin word for equal days.
The so called vernal equinox happens when the tilt of 
the earth's axis isn't facing towards or away from the sun.

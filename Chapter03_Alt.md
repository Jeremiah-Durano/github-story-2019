#Â Chapter 03 Alternate Ending


Welcome, welcome to the Alternate ending of this beautiful story titled "Spring's Beauty &amp; it's Wonders".
I'm sure by the time you end up reading this you've fallen asleep quite a few times.

Although Spring is great and many people do like it, but to me it really just is a transitional season. People nowadays are quite busy with their lives that paying to attention to the season is basically a waste of time. 
Your 9 to 5 job will still be there no matter what season Winter,Spring,Summer or Fall. 

I actually don't like Spring but I love summer and Winter. Hopefully I didn't bore you. Thanks for reading!

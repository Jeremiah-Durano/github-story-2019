# Chapter 02

As we know many animals migrate to the south during the winter. Then as the temperatures rise they proceed to to the north. A good sign that Spring is here is when you hear the birds chirping from the tree trops and seeing them spread their glorious wings as they glide through the air. 

Many animals also do reproduce during spring time. Due to the temperatures are warmer and food is in abundance.
Hence, the birth of many baby bunnies , ducklings and much more. "Like, Who doesn't want to see a cute little baby bunny?" Plus chasing a few squirrels around the park couldn't hurt, I guess.

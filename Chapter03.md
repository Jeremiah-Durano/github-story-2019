# Chapter 03

Spring is great. Seeing colourful flowers bloom, like the tulips and hyacinth's. Even the bright and yellow colour of the daffodils or the velevety texture of the jewel-like flower of the crocus can in some situations be a mood booster.

Another cool thing is that you can see more greenery since leaves are growing on the trees again.
The nice colours of the sunburst honey locusts, river birches and the swamp tupelo trees is a nice touch.
If your into the colour purple or violet maybe looking at a foxglove tree will enlighten your mood.

Seeing nature together and socialising with friends might be a good idea. Since the weather isn't too bad at all 
going out and enjoying the scenery can be good for your mental and phyical well-being and health in general since the sun is out most of the time so your body can produce more vitamin D. The more vitamins, the better!
